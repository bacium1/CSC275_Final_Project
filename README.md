As someone who speaks fluent French, I have always been interested in living for a period of time in Paris. Through this project, I sought to find the most reviewed Paris Aribnbs that have a minimum stay of 14 days. I chose this minimum stay because this means that they are more likely to be geared towards people who plan on having longer stays. By using this app, you can select your range of prices and view the most reviewed Airbnbs as well as the area in which they are located.
